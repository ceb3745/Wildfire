	[MAKE ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. USE 'BULLET POINT' OUTLINES.]

	[USE PLAIN TEXT]


============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?

The program runs correctly according to implementation
- takes in arguements and changes implementation based on
the existance or no existance of the optional arguements

- updates the array based on the rules of fire spread by
checking how many of the neighboring cells contain a burning tree

- ends based on implementation choice

- catches if there are no fires on generation 0 not generation 1. 

[e.g. does it run right or crash, infinite loop when it should not, other?]

	[you will lose fewer points if 
	 you clearly describe the problems
	 and your work to solve those problems.]




============= PROGRAM USAGE, OPTIONS AND Extra Credit ==

If you implemented extra credit or special, describe your results here.

I changed the final message to change based on singular or plural to the word
change. I found during testing that many times the final stage would have one 
fire left and only one more change to make and then in the final stage there
would be "1 changes" so I changed it to say "1 change".

[see the writeup for extra credit requirements if this applies to your work.]



============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

I learned a lot about how to use structs and pointers. I would've never been as
risky as to use structs and pointer myself and I like that this lab allowed me to 
experiment with my knowledge. I learned a lot about debugging. I was constantly popping
in and out of gdb trying to debug the simplest of problems. 

What was easy about this assignment?

The easiest thing about this assignment was the concept. Having done the homework previously
on Conway's game of life I understood the basics of implementation the trouble was really 
elsewhere.

What gave you problems or troubles?

The most troublesome thing for me was the copying of the arrays. I eventually found out that
memcopy would not work for the way that I set up my array of structs and I was stuck on that
for days trying to figure out why my array wasn't actually changing in the correct order. It 
was because the pointers to neighbors in the copy array were the same pointers from the orig
array.

What would you like the instructor to do to improve this assignment?

I think that the format of the instructions could be improved. I understand the way the write
up is presented is something that is done throughout everything. I think that the entire
process would be easier to understand if it was structered more pleasing to the eye, even if
there were more pictures so that there was visual and spatial representation of concepts. 

What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

I think that I have exhausted what I would like to do with the assignment itself. The knowledge
of structs makes me want to look into more different types of data management.
