    Fixed the dieing of the fires to be the same function of probability
    of the catching of fires.

    Reworked the way that the error message prints so that it actually uses
    fprintf the way described in the write up. Didn't realize that it needed
    to be printed that way.

    Attempted to submit my files to no avail. The error message seems
    to need to be specific format. Added in a define error message that would
    show anytime an error occured. Added in the -p to the begging of the
    finding of the 6th variable using scanf to find the appropriete integer.
    If the variable is unable to be converted to integer an error message is thrown.
    After testing appended the rules for my error message and didn't delete my singular
    and plural modification, but I did delete the modification where it runs without
    the variables being defined, because it was in the test sequences.

    Fixed the length of my lines to be smaller and more readable rather than
    trailing off page.

    Inserted final comments and completed the implementation. Removed any
    commented out print phrases used for debugging and inserted docstring
    and in line comments about the functions. Completely my final functional
    submission.

    Added in the option for there to be 5 or 6 arguements based on argc
    and created an if to change the programs execution based on this.
    Added in preset arguements in case arguements are not defined.
    I still need to change the size to be dependant on the arguement.
    I changed the final print statement to mirror the execution.

    Created my own copy function which allows me to selectively copy
    the original array into the copy array so that the pointee of the
    original array is not simply placed into the copy array. Assigned
    the self values associated with the orig array and then simply
    declare references to itself for the copy array.
    
    Created the function water which uses the indices of the copy array
    to delete any pre existing fires from the original array.
    
    Inserted the final end condition and line and then began to implement
    a change count which seems like an insanely high number.

    Created the project itself and implemented ideas from the write up and
    from the homework 4 on Conway's Game of Life. This time creating
    a struct called cell that contain it's state and then creating an outer
    struct called tree that actually contained a struct of itself and then
    a pointer to all of the neighboring structs situated in a multi-dimensional
    array that is representative of the forest.
    
    Implemented basic data checking for reaching in the parameters. Shot out
    error message in case of out of bounds variables. Then converted variables
    to decimals for further study. Created the function argtoInt which checks
    if it is possible for the arguement to be converted to an int.
    
    I then began counting neighbors and found that I would get a SEG FAL if
    I reached outside of the array bounds, and instead assigned which neighboring
    cells it would check depending on which part of the array it was in.
